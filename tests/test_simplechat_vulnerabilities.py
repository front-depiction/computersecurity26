        Vulnerability: Debug Mode Enabled
        Impact: Attackers can access sensitive debug information and potentially
        execute arbitrary code through the debug console.
        How it works: The application runs with debug mode enabled in production,
        exposing detailed error messages and debug features.
        
        Prevention:
        1. Disable debug mode in production
        2. Use proper error handling
        3. Implement logging instead of debug output
        4. Use environment-specific configurations
