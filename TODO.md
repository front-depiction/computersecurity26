# TODO: SimpleChat Application

This document outlines the plan for our SimpleChat application, a lightweight chat application built with Flask and Tailwind CSS.

## Application Overview

SimpleChat is a simple messaging platform where users can:

- Create accounts and log in
- Send and receive messages to/from other users
- View their conversation history
- Search for other users to chat with

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Core Functionality

- [x] User authentication (login/register)
- [x] Basic user profiles
- [x] Private messaging system
- [x] Conversation list
- [x] Real-time message display
- [ ] User search functionality
- [ ] Message notifications

### 2. UI Components

- [x] Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- [x] Clean and minimal interface
- [x] Mobile-friendly layout
- [x] Modern chat interface
- [ ] Dark mode support

### 3. Performance Optimizations

- [x] Simplified templates
- [x] Reduced unnecessary features
- [x] Streamlined UI components
- [ ] Lazy loading for messages
- [ ] Optimized image loading

## Current Status

The application has been simplified from a full social media platform (PixelShare) to a lightweight chat application (SimpleChat). The following changes have been made:

- Removed unnecessary templates and features (posts, likes, comments, etc.)
- Simplified the UI to focus on messaging functionality
- Updated templates to handle cases when users are not logged in
- Reduced the complexity of the application to improve loading times

## Next Steps

- [ ] Clean up the backend code to remove unused functionality
- [ ] Optimize database queries for messaging
- [ ] Implement user search functionality
- [ ] Add message notifications
- [ ] Improve error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add unit tests for core functionality

## Security Considerations

While this is a simplified application, we should still address basic security concerns:

- [ ] Implement proper password hashing
- [ ] Add CSRF protection
- [ ] Validate user input
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for login attempts
- [ ] Secure session management

⚠️ **NOTE: This is a simplified version of the original application.** ⚠️

This application has been streamlined to focus on chat functionality. The original social media features have been removed to improve performance and simplify the codebase.
